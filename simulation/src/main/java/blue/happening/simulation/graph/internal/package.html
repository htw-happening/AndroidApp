<body>

This package contains the supporting code behind {@code NetworkGraph}.
None of the classes and methods residing in this package should be used
outside of it. The average user, interested in running simulations,
should not be concerned with this package. However if you are interested
in understanding how the under laying discrete-event mathematics work,
start from reading {@code VertexArrivalAction}'s code.
